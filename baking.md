# Factory of Ashraf Product Ltd.

This small project looks at using fucntions and TDD.
We are also implementing Agile and Scrum principles.

Topics covered include 
- Functions 
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile 
- Scrum 


### Functions
Functions are like people at work... they have one job!
This makes it easier to test.

### How do they work?
1. We need to define them
2. Then call them
3. They run the block that is indented. 

Other functionality: 
They can take in arguments to be dynamic of morph the output

If a variable is like a box, you name it and place things inside. For example, a box named cookies can hold bottles of water.

A **function** is like a machine. It can interact with the objects in the box and follow your instructions. 

### Why functions?
They keep the code D.R.Y!
Allowing us to call said function to repeatedly run the block of code. 
#### Best practices re functions

- naming conventions; best to do it like a variable, lower_case_underscore
- IT DOES ONE JOB (or maybe two... shhh)
- Do not print in functions!
- separation of concerns principle(exists at network and infrastructure level)
    - helps remove single point of failure in code
    - makes codes cleaner and more maintainable 
    
 ## Basis of test
A test has known or controlled inputs and expected outputs. All it is, is an assertion.

Unit test is the testing of one simple function. 

Run it, get True or False.
